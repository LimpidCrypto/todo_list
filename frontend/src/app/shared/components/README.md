# Components

## Atoms:
### Purpose:
Atoms are the smallest building blocks, representing basic UI elements.
### Examples:
- Buttons
- Inputs
- Icons
- Labels
### Rules:
- Should be stateless and reusable.
- Focus on a single responsibility.
- Don't contain complex logic.

## Molecules:
### Purpose:
Molecules are groups of atoms bonded together, forming more complex components.
### Examples:
- Form groups
- Input with label
- Navigation bar
### Rules:
- Combine atoms to form a cohesive unit.
- Handle simple logic related to the grouping of atoms.

## Organisms:
### Purpose:
Organisms are even larger components that consist of molecules and atoms, forming a distinct section of the UI.
### Examples:
- Header
- Footer
- Sidebar
### Rules:
- Can contain state and business logic.
- Coordinate the interaction between molecules and atoms.
